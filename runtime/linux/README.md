# Linux Runtime Assets

This folder is reserved for portable Linux runtime artifacts.

Planned contents:
- rootfs bundle (Ubuntu-like userland)
- launcher helpers
- checksums and source manifests

For source-control hygiene, large runtime binaries are bootstrap-installed on target hosts
or attached to release artifacts, not committed directly to git.
